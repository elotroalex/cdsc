- Program: "Artist in Residence 2023"
  Name of Artist: "Ruben Cabenda"
  Artist statement: "Ruben Cabenda is an artist who mainly focuses on slavery and identity. In his animation, he uses a language that abstractly and figuratively depicts the history of slavery. The moving images in his work show how the past is still interwoven with the present, and decolonization is still an ongoing process. Through his animation, you see how descendants of the slaves, their identities, are snatched and deformed, bearing the traces of colonialism. The process of decolonizing our mindset is on the move to perceive things from a different perspective."
