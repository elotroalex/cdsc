  Description of the project (150 words max): "“Recasting Credit and Capital” is a digital mapping project that ties the Supreme Court decisions based on the debt recovery claims of Atlantic merchants in the Lower Mississippi Valley to how property is bought, sold, and mortgaged locally by planters and merchants. David’s research is based on deed and mortgage records to provide a timeline with a slider that corresponds to the history of legal cases over property, the seizing of assets such as slaves, and the effect of international conflicts on the rise of the plantation complex. The map enables students and instructors to connect the connections between slavery, the law, and space configuration in the lower Delta. Elbra’s project invites us to consider the connections of the Lower Mississippi Valley with the Greater Caribbean."

Serving as a multidimensional map, it traces the geographic route of Afro-Caribbean migrants from countries in the Caribbean Sea to new lands they call home to psychic spaces they produce. This installation is an artisanal tech approach that rejects realism and trusts black folks’ perception to become attuned to cultural perspectives on space and memory. It syncretizes spatial technologies such as the body and 3-D terrestrial laser scanning to reclaim African-syncretic rituals that have been subject to legal and social persecution, celebrate the lives and memories that endure migration, and address the conjuncture of embodied spirituality and geospatial technologies as media capable of enabling or disabling situatedness."

The platform crafts a genealogy of how organic intellectuals in the first colony of the Americas resist, accommodate, and endure during the colonial period (1492-1844). Shadow Scholars ask users to expand on what constitutes intellectualism in Caribbean history. It shows us how digital resources help us acknowledge Caribbean actors as part of the rich intellectual production beyond the realm of letters."

  Description of the project (150 words max): "The project focused on preparing the TLS spatial data from the UNESCO site of Sans-Souci, an early 19th-century palace associated with the Kingdom of Haiti (1811-1820), for open-access digital dissemination. The overarching goal of the project’s visualization, publication, and archiving activities is to make the 3D models available in online and offline formats for professionals from and working on Haiti, Caribbean history, historic preservation, and Black Studies. The Kingdom of Haiti is a powerful example of Black sovereignty in an era dominated by European colonial empires, sovereignty, and materiality manifested in Sans-Souci's monumental architecture. Although complicated, facilitating research and promoting awareness of this history are crucial to balancing colonial narratives about the past. The project brings attention to accessible, inclusive 3D work, multilingual users, and varying technological proficiency. It also addresses how scholars in well-resourced environments can collaborate with communities in the Global South by empowering them with digital technologies and transferring resources.a"
