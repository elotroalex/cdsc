        The Caribbean Digital Scholarship Collective (CDSC) is pleased to launch its annual micro-grant program to support digital scholarship in and about the Caribbean". The CDSC micro-grant program will serve as a model to the community at large, and can nudge the field of theory and practice as a whole in directions that are not only innovative for Caribbean Digital Scholarship but for Digital Scholarship in general.</p>

      <h3 style="width: 100%;" id="evaluation-and-selection">Evaluation and Selection</h3>
      <p>
        The CDSC will host an informational webinar to answer applicants'
        questions about the requirements and expectations of the grant on August
        2, 2022, at 1 pm EST.
        <a href="https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJckduyurjgqHtZaQWXinoC5iEj45BMV4C-V"><u>Register
            for the informational webinar</u></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        An editorial board of four members will review the applications and
        select the awardees. The board will be formed by the CDSC micro-grant
        program coordinator, the CDSC Grant Associate Director, a CDSC rotating
        member, and a rotating external jury member.
      </p>
      <p>
        The board will read through proposals in one round of selection using
        criteria designed for
        <a href="https://archipelagosjournal.org/reviewers.html"><em><u>archipelagos journal</u></em></a>, notably, the
        overall scholarly contribution, equity and inclusion
        (when appropriate), thoughtful design, and preservation strategy. The
        CDSC will also assist when needed in the preparation of the proposal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CDSC committee will select the grantees in Fall 2022 and disburse
        the micro-grants by Winter 2023.
      </p>
      <h3 style="width: 100%;" id="grantees-expectations">Grantees Expectations</h3>
      <p>
        The length of the proposed project and deliverables should range between
        January and December 2023. The CDSC expects grantees to present their
        projects at the
        <a href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/"><u>2023 TCD conference</u></a>. Grantees should be amenable to having
        their projects featured on the
        CDSC website, social media, and other communications; acknowledge the
        CDSC's support in their public-facing materials; and participate in
        public events about the micro-grant program.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the funding period, the CDSC will earmark one
        micro-grantee in each award round as a flagship project. These flagship
        projects will serve as models to the community at large, and they can
        nudge the field of theory and practice in creative directions for
        Caribbean Digital Scholarship in particular and Digital Scholarship in
        general. <a href="https://sameboats.org/"><u>In The Same Boats</u></a>, a set of interactive mapping
        visualizations that trace the movements
        of significant cultural actors from the Caribbean and broader Americas,
        Africa, and Europe within the 20th century Afro-Atlantic world, is an
        example of these possible flagship projects.
