<p>The Caribbean Digital Scholarship Collective (CDSC) is pleased
to launch its second annual micro-grant program to support digital
scholarship in and about the Caribbean and its diasporas.</p>
<h2 id="section"></h2>
<h3 id="about-the-grant">About the Grant</h3>
<p>The CDSC welcomes applications from original digital humanities
and digital scholarship projects at any stage, from inception to
currently in development. Look at the <a
href="https://cdscollective.org/microgrant-recipients-2022/"><u>2022-23
microgrant recipients</u></a> and read the <a
href="https://cdscollective.org/micro-grants/"><u>program page</u></a>
for details.</p>
<p>The CDSC will support at least five projects from January to
December 2024, offering grants ranging from USD $1,000 to
$20,000. The length of the proposed project and deliverables
should be completed within 12 months. Applicants need to apply for
a micro-grant in one of three tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TIER 1 ($15,000 – $20,000)</strong>: Tier 1 grants are
for medium to large projects that require significant expenses. For
example, projects that imagine creating an artisanal tech solution that
does not exist yet, such as an original cartographic interface or
visualization, or projects with expensive labor and technology
requirements.</li>
<li><strong>TIER 2 ($5,000 – $15,000):</strong> Tier 2 grants are
for small to medium-sized projects with readily available technology.
For example, digital archives, exhibits built with Omeka or Wax, or maps
created with Carto or Google Maps which need funds to pay for data
curation, management, and training.</li>
<li><strong>TIER 3 (less than $5,000):</strong> Tier 3 grants
support one or two individuals as they pursue small to medium-sized
digital scholarship, pedagogical or public humanities projects that they
are developing themselves. Projects in Tier 3 are usually at their early
stages and require further funding to come to fruition or grow in scale
later.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The funding tiers are flexible. If a tier does not apply to
your project needs, explain in your proposal why you are applying for a
different tier than the one we would have assigned to your
project.</em></p>
