<p>The Caribbean Digital Scholarship Collective (CDSC) is pleased
to launch its second annual micro-grant program to support digital
scholarship in and about the Caribbean and its diasporas.</p>

<h2 id="Key Facts">Key Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Deadline to apply: September 15, 2024, 11:59 p.m. EST</li>
  <li>Announcements: December 2024</li>
  <li>Funding period: January-December 2025</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="about-the-grant">About the Grant</h3>
<p>The CDSC welcomes applications from original digital humanities and digital scholarship projects at any stage, from inception to currently in development. Look at the <a
href="https://cdscollective.org/microgrant-recipients-2023/"><u>2023-24 microgrant recipients</u></a> and read the <a
href="https://cdscollective.org/micro-grants/"><u>program page</u></a>
for details.</p>
<p>The CDSC will support at least five projects from January to December 2024, offering grants ranging from USD $1,000 to $20,000. The length of the proposed project and deliverables should be completed within 12 months. Applicants need to apply for a micro-grant in one of three tiers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>TIER 1 ($12,500 – $20,000) | One prize maxi:</strong>: medium to large projects that require significant expenses. For example, projects that imagine creating an artisanal tech solution that does not exist yet, such as an original cartographic interface or visualization, or projects with expensive labor and technology requirements</li>
  <li><strong>TIER 2 ($5,000 – $12,500) | Two prizes max:</strong>small to medium-sized projects with readily available technology. For example, digital archives, exhibits built with Omeka or Wax, or maps created with Carto or Google Map which need funds to pay for data curation, management, and training.</li>
  <li><strong>TIER 3 (less than $5,000):</strong> one or two individuals as they pursue small to medium-sized digital scholarship, pedagogical, or public humanities projects that they are developing themselves. Projects in Tier 3 are usually at their early stages and require further funding to come to fruition or grow in scale later.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The funding tiers are flexible. If a tier does not suit your project's needs, explain in your proposal why you are applying for a tier different from the one we would have assigned.</em></p>
