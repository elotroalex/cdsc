   <p>Create Caribbean Research Institute (CCRI) is the first digital humanities center in the Caribbean. CCRI operates in Dominica and Jamaica and serves students and scholars in academic research, technology, education, and Caribbean digital scholarship, focusing on arts and humanities work.</p>
<p>Create Caribbean is expanding its higher education programs in Dominica and the Eastern Caribbean and developing new projects and partnerships in Caribbean Digital Scholarship.</p>
<p>CCRI is currently developing the following initiatives:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Research, Technology, Community Internship Program:</strong> based at Dominica State College and The University of the West Indies, Mona, includes a Caribbean Digital Studies certificate, funding for student interns, and apprenticeships with community partners where students apply their digital skills to preserve and share content.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Partners Program:</strong> a program that invites local agencies and organizations working in cultural heritage, education, and preservation to use digital technology to strengthen content development and programming. The Community Partners Program includes sponsored Summer Intensive Training, a 60-hour intensive workshop designed to introduce digital humanities tools and methods to community partners.</li>
    <li><strong>Caribbean Writers’ Room:</strong> This online platform for emerging writers of the Caribbean provides a space for learning and sharing work within and beyond the region. It brings together the benefits of digital humanities, open source and publishing platforms, and an eager literary community in an online platform. Caribbean Writers’ Room offers virtual six-week writing workshops, live and recorded master classes with Caribbean writers, resources on publishing, festivals, literary agents and development of the craft.</li>
</ul>
<p>CCRI has operated since 2014 under the leadership of Prof. Schuyler Esprit and hosts various annual programs and activities, including Create and Code Summer Tech Camp.</p>
