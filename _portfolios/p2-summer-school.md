The Caribbean Digital Scholarship Summer Institute (CDSsi) will train scholars interested in approaching Caribbean Studies and digital scholarship as organically integrated fields of inquiry and engagement. Programs of study that integrate these domains are hard to come by in today's universities and to secure a viable future for digital scholarship in Caribbean Studies, we need a more expansive pool of talent. A common means of bridging these gaps has been the convening of generalist summer institutes (such as the Digital Humanities Summer Institute at the University of Victoria, or Dream Lab at the University of Pennsylvania). These have proven to be insufficiently accessible to many Caribbean scholars for various reasons, including high cost, logistics of international travel, and a tendency to center Europe, Canada, and the US. The CDSsi will attend to these problems by providing training in Caribbean digital scholarship. </p>

<p>Selected Caribbean studies scholars and practitioners will serve as instructors and their courses will include a focus on computational approaches to corpora (text and media analysis, general use of computation, statistics, data science); academic organizing on digital networks; digital pedagogy; and/or the design and implementation of knowledge systems (digital archives, exhibits, maps, visualizations) beyond the use of templated solutions.</p>

<p>Thanks to generous Mellon funding for the program, we will be able to support  travel for up to 30 scholars to attend the CDSsi in summer 2023-25. Applications are forthcoming in early Spring 2023.</p>
