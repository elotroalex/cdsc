     <p>The production of digital scholarship projects in the Caribbean region and/or by Caribbean Studies scholars needs to overcome five common obstacles: lack of funds, lack of training, lack of guidance, lack of teams, and lack of time. To foster the work of digital scholarship in the Caribbean from independent groups, the CDSC offers micro-grants to support a wide range of projects that can elevate Caribbean digital scholarship, including online catalogs, digitized collections, apps and digital tools, pedagogical platforms, spatial analysis, textual analysis, e-learning, and public outreach efforts, among others.</p>
<p>The CDSC micro-grant program is a condensed version of traditional start-up and implementation grants. The program’s offer financial resources to researchers working in digital humanities and digital scholarship projects, with awards ranging from $1,000 to $20,000 during a 12-month period. The program also supports grantees with light mentorship by the Microgrant mentor and a cohort system to strengthen community-building and support troubleshooting during the completion of the grant.</p>
<p>The micro-grant program is open to individuals and groups from educational, research, and community organizations working in Caribbean Studies, and independent scholars. The committee prioritizes individuals, groups and works representing the Caribbean region and its global diasporas. Proposals are evaluated based on their intellectual contributions to Caribbean Digital scholarship, engagement with digital methods and tools to advance research, teaching, learning, and/or public engagement, and projected deliverables. Visit our <a href="/_micro-grants/cfp2024.html" target="_blank">Call for Proposals</a> for more information about eligibility and application requirements.</p>
