     <p>Computational research and public humanities projects are the core
exercises of digital scholarship. The production of digital scholarship
projects in the Caribbean region and/or by Caribbean Studies scholars
needs to overcome five common obstacles: lack of funds, lack of
training, lack of guidance, lack of teams, and lack of time. To foster
the work of digital scholarship in the Caribbean from independent
groups, the CDSC offers micro-grants to support a wide range of projects
that can elevate Caribbean digital scholarship, including online
catalogs, digitized collections, apps and digital tools, pedagogical
platforms, spatial analysis, textual analysis, e-learning, and public
outreach efforts, among others.</p>
<p>The CDSC micro-grant program works as a condensed version of
traditional start-up and implementation grants. The program offers three
rounds of micro-grants, from 2023 to 2025. The program supports at least
five (5) projects each year, offering financial resources ranging from
$1,000 to $20,000, depending on need. Each awardee can also receive
light mentorship by the CDSC.</p>
<h2 id="section"></h2>
<h2 id="general-requirements">General Requirements </h2>
<p>Applicants must submit a proposal explaining the project scope;
intellectual contributions; engagement with digital methods and tools to
advance research, teaching, learning, and/or public engagement; a plan
of execution; and projected deliverables. Applicants will also need to
submit an itemized budget and budget rationale. The length of the
proposed project and deliverables should be completed within 12
months.</p>
<h2 id="section-1"></h2>
<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility </h2>
<ul>
<li>Individuals and groups from educational, research, and community
organizations working in Caribbean Studies and based anywhere in the
world.</li>
<li>Independent scholars anywhere in the world working in Caribbean
Studies.</li>
<li>Caribbean-based scholars who are working on any area related to
Digital Scholarship.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The CDSC will prioritize individuals, groups and/or work
representing the Caribbean regions and its global
diasporas.</strong></p>
<h2 id="section-2"></h2>
<h2 id="mentorship">Mentorship </h2>
<p>The CDSC will assist applicants when needed in preparing the
proposal. The CDSC will host information webinars before the application
deadline to answer applicants' questions. The committee might pair the
awardees with mentors who will help awardees determine how best to use
their resources, scope properly and make recommendations.</p>
<p>The CDSC has partnered with <a
href="https://www.performantsoftware.com/"><u>Performant
Software</u></a> for a discount for some types of projects. If needed,
applicants can hire Performant to execute their project. If Performant
is not the right fit for your project, we will help you connect with
other contractors in our network. In addition, the CDSC will provide
some mentorship and project management support for awardees throughout
the completion of their projects when needed.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-and-selection">Evaluation and Selection </h2>
<p>A committee will review the applications and select the awardees. The
CDSC microgrant program coordinators, a CDSC rotating member, and a
rotating external jury member will form the committee.</p>
<p>The committee will evaluate proposals using the criteria designed for
<a href="https://archipelagosjournal.org/reviewers.html"
target="_blank"><em>archipelagos journal</em></a>.
As opposed to <em>archipelagos</em> submissions, proposed
projects for the micro-grant do not need to be in an advanced stage. We
welcome original projects at any stage, from inception to currently in
development.</p>
<h2 id="section-3"></h2>
<h2 id="grantees-expectations">Grantees Expectations</h2>
<p>The CDSC expects grantees to present their projects at the <a
href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/"><u>TCD conference</u></a>.
Grantees should be amenable to having their projects featured on the
CDSC website, social media, and other communications; acknowledge the
CDSC's support in their public-facing materials; and participate in
public events about the micro-grant program.</p>
<p>Grantees will be expected to participate actively in a cohort with
other grantees. More often than not, digital scholarship projects
overlap with others, and a shared pool of knowledge and a common space
will benefit everyone. Based on other fellowship and grant programs, we
hope being part of a cohort will help build community, support
troubleshooting, and benefit the grantee's projects.</p>
