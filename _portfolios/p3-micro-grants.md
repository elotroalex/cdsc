    <p>Computational research and public humanities projects are the core exercises of digital scholarship. The production of digital scholarship projects in the Caribbean region and/or by Caribbean Studies scholars suffers from five common obstacles: lack of funds, lack of training, lack of guidance, lack of teams, and lack of time. The institutes and the academic programs can help address these gaps. To foster the work of digital scholarship in the Caribbean from independent teams, the CDSC proposes disbursing micro-grants for small Caribbean Digital Humanities project support. This form of micro-granting can serve to build momentum in the production of innovative and needed work.</p>
    <p>The CDSC micro-grant program will serve as a smaller, condensed version of traditional start-up and implementation grants. The CDSC will offer three rounds of micro-grants for the duration of the Mellon grant from 2023 to 2025. Each year we will support a minimum of five (5) projects, offering financial resources ranging from $1,000 to $25,000, depending on need. Each awardee may be assigned a mentor from the CDSC or a remunerated fellow Caribbeanist scholar. Remunerated mentors will receive $1000.</p> 
    <h4>Evaluation and Selection</h4>
    <p>An editorial board of four members will review the applications and select the awardees: Alex Gil, CDSC micro-grant program coordinator; Andreina Soto, CDSC Grant Associate Director; a rotating member of the CDSC; and a rotating external jury member. The CDSC will compensate outside reviewers who join in the selection process with $1,000 per round.
    <p>The selection process will consist of one round involving the reading of proposals and a joint deliberation. The board will read through the proposals using criteria designed for <a href="https://archipelagosjournal.org/reviewers.html" target="_blank">archipelagos journal</a>, notably, the overall scholarly contribution, equity and inclusion (when appropriate), thoughtful design, and preservation strategy. As opposed to submissions to archipelagos, proposed projects for the micro-grant do not need to be in an advanced stage. We welcome original projects at any stage, from inception to currently in development.</p>
    <h4>Mentorship</h4>
    <p>The CDSC will assist applicants when needed in the preparation of the proposal. The CDSC will host information webinars before the application deadline to answer applicants' questions.</p>
   <p>The board might pair the awardees with mentors. Mentors will be available for light consultation and meet with awardees for a minimum of three sessions (one at the beginning, middle, and end of the process). The mentors can make themselves available for queries and consultations as needed on a CDSC channel created for the cohort as a whole. Mentors will help awardees determine how best to use their resources, scope properly, answer technical questions when possible or point towards an answer, and make recommendations for project management.</p>
    <p>At the end of the funding period, the CDSC will earmark one awardee in each award round as a flagship project. These flagship projects will serve as models to the community at large, and they can nudge the field of theory and practice in creative directions for Caribbean Digital Scholarship in particular and Digital Scholarship in general. <a href="https://sameboats.org/" target="_blank">In The Same Boats</a>, a set of interactive mapping visualizations that trace the movements of significant cultural actors from the Caribbean and wider Americas, Africa, and Europe within the 20th century Afro-Atlantic world, is an example of one of these possible flagship projects.</p>
