<p>The Caribbean Digital conference (TCD) is an international event hosted annually at locations in the United States and the Caribbean since 2014. Alternating between events convened via an open invitation and smaller events convened by invitation, TCD has created a singular and consistent space of exchange for Caribbeanist digital scholars, consisting of traditional panels, roundtable conversations, skills-building workshops, and project show-and-tells. The work done in preparation for this gathering and produced in its wake has led to the publication, in <a href="http://archipelagosjournal.org" target="_blank">archipelagos journal</a> alone of more than thirty peer-reviewed scholarly articles and digital projects and to the development of several ongoing digital artifacts, including a collectively generated bibliography, a  <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://cahier1939ms.github.io/texts/translation/" target="_blank"> collective translation</a>, a <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/" target="_blank">keywords project</a>, and a <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/caridischo/" target="_blank">directory</a> of Caribbean digital scholarship.</p>
<p>As a vehicle for discussing and presenting work emerging from the various summer institutes, micro-grants, and academic programs, TCD foregrounds the cross-institutional ecosystems of scholars, artists, activists, and students.</p>
<p>Historically, TCD has been financed ad-hoc through a combination of small institutional partners and small research grants, in order to remain free of charge to presenters and attendees. During the Mellon grant period, we will host two open-call conferences and two invited-speaker symposia in different locations in the continental US and the Caribbean. The CDSC covers stipends, travel, and accommodation costs for the presenters and keynote speakers who participate in TCD. We also offer travel grants to graduate student attendees from under-resourced institutions who demonstrate an interest in Caribbean digital scholarship.</p>
