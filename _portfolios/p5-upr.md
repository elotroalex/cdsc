<p>The University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus (UPR-PR) is developing a comprehensive and sustainable plan for promoting Digital Humanities in Puerto Rico. This initiative, called UPR Caribe Digital, includes the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DH Fellows Initiative (DHFI) is a capacity-building strategies program that trains professors, researchers, and librarians in the development of digital projects. Each year, the selected DH Fellow participates in conferences, workshops, and design intensive modules on DH pedagogy and ethics, DH visualization and data design, sustainable practices in DH, among others.</li>
  <li>DH Scholars-in-Residence Program  <a href="https://www.uprcaribedigital.org/dh-scholars" target="_blank">(DHSRP)</a> is a program that fosters research competencies in DH among UPR-RP students, faculty  <a href="https://www.uprcaribedigital.org/mentores" target="_blank">mentors</a>, and <a href="https://www.uprcaribedigital.org/comunitario" target="_blank">community-based organizations</a>. Participants develop skills related to library science, basic computer programming, and digital curation. Students also collaborate with community partners to create a DH project throughout the academic year.</li>
  <li>Digital Humanities Undergraduate Academic Minor (DHUAM): knowing that the future of Caribbean DH is in the hands of its users, UPR Caribe Digital is creating the first undergraduate academic minor on Digital Humanities in Puerto Rico under the <a href="http://humanidades.uprrp.edu/prei/" target="_blank">Interdisciplinary Studies Program </a> at the College of Humanities UPR-RP.</li>
</ul>
<p>UPR Caribe Digital is carrying out these initiatives with the help of the <a href="https://cea.uprrp.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Academic Excellence </a> and the Dean’s Office of Academic Affairs. They project these initiatives will benefit more than 120 professors and librarians, 65 university students, and 15 community organizations.</p>
