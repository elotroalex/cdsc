    <p>The University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus (UPR-PR) proposes a series of integrated efforts to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable plan to promote Digital Humanities in Puerto Rico. The initiative, called UPR Caribe Digital, will develop the following projects:</p>
    <p>1) A Digital Humanities Fellow Initiative (DHFI) for capacity building strategies. This program will train professors, researchers, and librarians in all aspects related to the development of digital projects. The DH fellows will participate in conferences, workshops, and intensive modules in topics related to: DH pedagogy and ethics, DH visualization and data design, and sustainable practices in DH among others.</p>
    <p>2) A DH Scholars-in-Residence Program (DHSRP) for undergraduate students and community partners. This program is designed to foster research competencies in DH among students, faculty mentors and community based groups. Participants will develop skills in areas related to library science, basic computer programming and digital curation. At the end of the academic year, the students in collaboration with community groups will create a DH project.</p>
    <p>3) The creation of a Digital Humanities Undergraduate Academic Minor (DHUAM): Knowing that the future of Caribbean DH is in the hands of users, we will create the first undergraduate academic minor on Digital Humanities in Puerto Rico under the <a href="http://humanidades.uprrp.edu/prei/">Interdisciplinary Studies Program</a> at the College of Humanities UPR-RP.</p>
    <p>UPR-RP professors Mirerza González-Vélez and Nadjah Ríos Villarini will lead these efforts along with the help of the Centro de Recursos de Investigación Interdisciplinaria y Creación Subgraduadas <a href="http://www.criiasupr.org/">(CRiiAS)</a> and the support of the CDSC. We estimate that, by the end of the project, over 120 professors and librarians, 65 undergraduate students, and 15 community organizations will benefit from the UPR-RP DH Caribbean Initiative. </p>
