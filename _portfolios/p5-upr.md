    <p>The University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus (UPR-PR) will develop a comprehensive and sustainable plan to promote Digital Humanities in Puerto Rico. This initiative, called UPR Caribe Digital, will include the following:</p>
    <p>1)  DH Fellows Initiative (DHFI): a program for capacity-building strategies that will train professors, researchers, and librarians in the development of digital projects. Each year, the selected DH Fellow will participate in conferences, workshops, and design intensive modules on DH pedagogy and ethics, DH visualization and data design, and sustainable practices in DH, among others.</p>
    <p>2) DH Scholars-in-Residence Program (DHSRP): a program designed to foster research competencies in DH among UPR-RP students, faculty mentors, and community-based groups. Participants will develop skills related to library science, basic computer programming, and digital curation. Students will also collaborate with community groups to create a DH project throughout the academic year.</p>
    <p>3) Digital Humanities Undergraduate Academic Minor (DHUAM): knowing that the future of Caribbean DH is in the hands of its users, UPR Caribe Digital will create the first undergraduate academic minor on Digital Humanities in Puerto Rico under the <a href="http://humanidades.uprrp.edu/prei/">Interdisciplinary Studies Program</a> at the College of Humanities UPR-RP.</p>
    <p>Professors Mirerza González-Vélez and Nadjah Ríos Villarini will lead these efforts along with the help of the Centro de Recursos de Investigación Interdisciplinaria y Creación Subgraduadas <a href="http://www.criiasupr.org/">(CRiiAS)</a> and the support of the CDSC. By the end of the Mellon grant, these initiatives will benefit over 120 professors and librarians, 65 undergraduate students, and 15 community organizations. </p>
