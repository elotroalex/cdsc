<p>Creative arts emerging from the Caribbean and its diasporas present a form of knowledge production that raises the same questions and concerns as those academics engage, offering alternative modes of expression to audiences that extend well beyond the academy.</p>
<p>Given the relevance of art as an important form of expression, the Digital Artist’s Virtual Residency supports Caribbean artists working in digital media. The residency is offered in conjunction with <a href="https://thecaribbeandigital.org/" target="_blank">The Caribbean Digital annual conference</a>, and in partnership with <a href="http://aliceyard.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Alice Yard</a>, a celebrated contemporary art collective based since 2006 in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>The virtual residency aims to facilitate the development of new artworks that investigate ideas and practices in Caribbean Digital Humanities and engage with scholars in our network and community. The program offers a cash stipend to support a six-month digital residency and curatorial guidance and mentorship from Trinidadian artist Christopher Cozier to produce born-digital art to be presented at The Caribbean Digital conference. The residency includes two virtual studio visits by professional critics and curators and the commissioning of a critical text for publication in <a href="https://archipelagosjournal.org/" target="_blank">archipelagos journal</a>. Artists also present their projects during TCD.</p>
