<h2>Starting Strong</h2> 

<p>The CDSC assembles a team of seasoned scholars and educators, in partnership with community groups and academic institutions, to offer various <a href="http://cdscollective.org/programs/" target="_blank">programs</a>
that support digital scholarship in and for the Caribbean. Our members have worked arduously for the past months, bringing this vision to life. Please have a read at some of our latest activities!</p>

<h3>The Caribbean Digital Virtual Artist's Residency</h3>
<p>As part of the CDSC, the Caribbean Digital Virtual Artist's Residency program will fund an artist per year for a residency tied to <a href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net//" target="_blank">The Caribbean Digital conference</a>. The residency program, coordinated by <a href="https://kbjosephs.net/=en" target="_blank">prof. Kelly Baker Josephs </a> in partnership with the art collective <a href="http://aliceyard.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Alice Yard</a>, offers a cash stipend to fund six months of part-time research, creative work, and mentorship for emerging digital artists in the Caribbean.</p>

<p>Artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mahrinnart/?hl=en" target="_blank">Marinna Shareef</a> from Trinidad and Tobago will be the TCD's inaugural Virtual Artist's Residency. Shareef is an early-career artist who graduated in 2019 with a BA in visual art from the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine.

<h3>UPR Caribe Digital educational programs</h3> 
<p><a href="http://cdscollective.org/upr/" target="_blank">UPR Caribe Digital</a> recently launched two educational programs to promote digital scholarship in Puerto Rico. UPR Caribe Digital selected <a href="https://hcommons.org/members/milaapontegonzalez/" target="_blank">prof. Mila Aponte</a> as their Fellow Resident, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/v%C3%ADctor-torres-rodr%C3%ADguez-497130194/" target="_blank">prof. Víctor Torres Rodríguez</a> as their Instructional Designer. Together, Aponte and Torres Rodríguez will develop a comprehensive program on digital literacy that will benefit the university’s students, librarians, professors, and researchers.</p>

<p>UPR Caribe Digital also selected the cohort for their inaugural DH Scholars in Residence program, which brings together university students and community partners to learn about digital preservation, curatorship, and digital content. Throughout the 2022-23 academic year, ten undergraduate students from the University of Puerto Rico-Río Piedras will work with five community partners to develop a DH project. This year's community partners include Taller Comunidad La Goyco, Fundación Juan Mar Brás, Siempre Vivas Metro, Fundación Culebra, and Organización Waves Ahead.</p>
