<p>This month, UPR Caribe Digital had its first meeting for the 2022-23 DH Scholars in Residence Program. Throughout three years, the program will train undergraduate students from University of Puerto Rico-Río Piedras (UPR-PR) and Puerto Rican community-based groups in digital humanities skills.</p>
<p>Throughout the session, the UPR-PR faculty emphasized the importance of creating academic knowledge for the service of local communities. “We want to make digital humanities, Caribbean style,” said CDSC Co-PI Nadjah Ríos during the session. For this, the DH Scholars in Residence program will immerse students in the world of digital humanities through workshops and discussions that will include strategic planning, ethical issues in DH, responsible outreach, information technologies, responsive design, among others.</p> 
<p>The students will also be able to apply their skills by working with a faculty mentor and a community partner to create a digital project. This year, the selected community partners are Waves Ahead, Fundación Mari Brás, Siempre Vivas Metro, Fundación Culebra, and Taller Comunidad La Goyco, whose members showed their enthusiasm to participate in this exciting program.</p> 
<p>UPR Caribe Digital is developing various initiatives that promise to grow the practice of digital humanities among the young population of Puerto Rico. Learn about the different <a href="http://cdscollective.org/programs/" target="_blank">CDSC programs</a>.</p>
