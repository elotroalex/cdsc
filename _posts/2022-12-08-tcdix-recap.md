The CDSC traveled to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to celebrate the ninth
iteration of The Caribbean Digital (TCD) conference. TCD is an annual
international event that has been held in the United States and the
Caribbean since 2014. After two years of virtual gathering in 2020 and
2021, TCD convened this year at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio
Piedras campus.

The first day started with a workshop led by CDSC Co-PI Alex Gil, titled
"Collection Data and Caribbean Cultural Heritage." Gil introduced
attendees to digital collections and exhibits by showcasing [Omeka-S](https://omeka.org/s/) and [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/). During the
workshop, Gil reflected upon the importance of community work and the
potential of minimal computing. He also invited attendees to imagine
diverse uses of technology that can serve the interests and needs of the Caribbean.

The question of access, preservation, and knowledge systems continued
the next day with two thought-provoking panels. In the first session,
[Nicté Fuller-Medina](https://nfullerm.wixsite.com/website),
[Stephanie Chancy](https://history.fiu.edu/people/postdoc-fellows/profiles/stephanie-chancy.html), and [Jessica Marie Johnson](https://www.jessicamariejohnson.com/) discussed
the dilemmas of preservation and the production of historical
narratives. Fuller-Medina, Chancy, and Johnson's work, which centers on
Belize's linguistic diversity, Haiti's built heritage, and Black Puerto
Ricans, respectively, constitute important examples of the potential
routes to rethinking historical heritage and preservation. As Johnson
states, "\[our work\] is not just about data, it is about stories and
about people." This work thus requires critical thinking about how
historical evidence can shape our notions of the past and about how
people engage with these narratives in their everyday lives.

The afternoon session continued with [Jeanmary Lugo](https://sites.google.com/site/jeanmarylugogonzalez/home?pli=1),
[Joel Blanco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jblancorivera/?originalSubdomain=mx),
and [Valeria Fernández](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valeria-S-Fernandez),
who have done extensive archival and community projects in Puerto Rico.
The presenters discussed, for example, archiving and documenting issues
of the present, such as the
[#RickyRenuncia](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/22/744093831/thousands-in-puerto-rico-seek-to-oust-rossell-in-massive-ricky-renuncia-march)
movement in March 2019. They also discussed the need for
community-centered work. When talking about the potential of Digital
Humanities, Lugo states, "we need to develop a network of professionals
and institutions that document and share resources, who create products
that help our immediate communities according to their needs, realities,
and limitations." Lugo, Blanco, and Fernández's work exemplify how local
librarians and archivists can create forms of preserving political
mobilization in Puerto Rico. They demonstrate how Caribbean specialists
use digital technologies with a critical, anti-racist outlook to
redefine notions of documenting and analyzing our past and present.

The Caribbean Digital was a vital space for conversations about the
present and the future of data curation and digital collections. The
conference gave a platform to researchers, librarians, and educators who
are doing important work in and about the Caribbean. We thank all the
participants and collaborators who made this conference possible!
