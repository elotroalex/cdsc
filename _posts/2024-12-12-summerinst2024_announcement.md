## The Caribbean Digital Scholarship Summer Institute (CDSsi) Summer 2024 Call for Applications is Here!

<p>The CDSsi is set to hold its second annual week-long residential program next year at the University of Miami. During the first iteration of this program, the CDSsi assembled a select number of amazing applicants who were archivists, librarians, faculty, and graduate students from across the Caribbean and United States to explore and learn skills for Caribbeanist centered digital scholarship. Courses they took focused on computational approaches, digital pedagogy, and the design and implementation of knowledge systems beyond the use of templated solutions. For one week, participants built critical foundational skills while establishing personal and professional connections with their peers and instructors. The second iteration of the institute’s summer program is set to go and will be held <u>June 9-15, 2024</u>. For information about the CDSsi and the call for applications, please visit their website page [here.](https://cdscollective.org/summer-school/)</p>
