        <h3>Working as a Collective</h3>
        <p>
          The combination of our funded instruments will allow us to energize
          the communities already working on Caribbean digital scholarship,
          while nurturing future talent. Our model depends on our ability as a
          collective to connect these different instruments with each other. The
          CDSC summer school, the microgrants and the academic programs promise
          to generate cohorts of students and practitioners, from across the
          Caribbean and the US, that can form lifelong bonds, as similar
          programs elsewhere demonstrate. The learning component will help us
          train the much-needed mixed-methods talent that we need not only in
          Caribbean Studies itself, but in the Caribbean region as a whole.

          The challenges of the 21st century demand no less of us as educators.
          The Andrew W. Mellon grant that undergirds our collective promises to
          be more than a patch—rather, it will help us build future structures
          that can continue beyond the grant, not only helping us attract
          investment from institutions in and outside the Caribbean for the
          non-tuition generating parts of our model, but also in the development
          of programs that can transition to tuition models at the end of the
          grant. The beneficiaries of the grant are clear: first, rising cohorts
          of scholars and memory professionals will be empowered with new tools
          and methods to steward Caribbean Studies well into the 21st century.
          Second, the region itself will benefit from the injection of new
          expressions of creativity and problem-solving, in a century when
          forces larger than the geographical scope of the Caribbean threaten to
          engulf it. Finally, the scholarly world at large will benefit from the
          unique forms of scholarship and practice that emerge from the
          particulars of Caribbean life and culture. We have seen all of these
          benefits––nascent and explicit––in our under-supported efforts over
          the years, and we look forward to seeing them grow with Mellon’s
          support.

          Indeed, having worked together for well over a decade, we are thrilled
          by the possibilities this grant presents for more fully realizing and
          sustaining the networks and bonds that have long undergirded our
          projects, both current and planned. These efforts are in important
          ways co-constitutive and interdependent, yet, in the absence of
          reliable resources, they have in the past been necessarily punctual.
          Our Collective rests upon a set of shared values embodied in these
          linked projects and praxes, both existing and to-be-developed. Our
          pedagogical initiatives (the traveling multi-institutional summer
          school; our micro-grants for nascent projects and ideas; the DH
          Fellowship and undergraduate Scholars-in-Residence program at the
          University of Puerto Rico; and the Create Caribbean Research Institute
          Undergraduate Intern incubator) are designed to function in dialogue
          with one another, fostering a community of expertise-holders who train
          Caribbeanist DH learners with a common set of skills, ethical
          principles, and long-term objectives.
