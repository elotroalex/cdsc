        <h3>Supporting Caribbean Digital Scholarship</h3>
        <p>
          For many years we have been asking ourselves the following questions
          and coming up with our own answers: How will we go about cultivating
          both producers and publics of quality digital scholarship, and how
          will we help to ensure that this scholarship is recognized and
          rewarded by the profession? How can we encourage collaboration with,
          increase accessibility for, and otherwise work to narrow the gap
          between Caribbeanist researchers, especially those in the North
          Atlantic academy, and the communities we are committed to serving? Our
          answers have ranged in nature and scope, but one thing is common to
          our collective: we have been working diligently to foster community
          and opportunities for our colleagues and students working on Caribbean
          digital scholarship.

          We all share an understanding of the challenges to these efforts and
          how best to confront them. We need more computational talent invested
          in the questions and concerns of Caribbean Studiesâ€”we need to train
          more students or professionals with computational knowledge in
          Caribbean Studies. We still find colleagues working in the silos that
          result from national, linguistic, and academic/disciplinary histories
          and borders. We operate in incredibly uneven terrain, with some of our
          scholars enjoying the benefits of working for well-resourced
          universities, while others work with little to no support. Those
          differences translate to unequal access to infrastructure at the most
          mundane material level: broadband internet, reliable electricity, safe
          working spaces, etc. Because of the nature of these obstacles, they
          cannot be addressed with a one-size-fits-all solution. As such, with
          this generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, we will
          address them using a combination of the instruments or progams below.
          Each collaborating institution will take primary responsibility for
          one or more of these instruments. To learn more about each one of
          them, click on the image to visit the program page.
