        <h3>Supporting Caribbean Digital Scholarship</h3>
        <p>
          Based on our experiences working with different digital projects in
          North America and the Caribbean, we have designed and implemented
          various training and outreach programs that, in turn, address local
          needs. These strategies work in dialogue with each other, fostering a
          community of trained Caribbean practitioners with a standard set of
          skills, ethical principles, and long-term goals.
